# Panorbit test assesment

This is a Itnowinc react test assesment. I got asigned on july 9 2023 submission date would be on the same day itself

## Project Description

This project is not built using tools like create-react-app or webpack. Instead, it is based on the latest technology with the vite template created by the vite team. The project utilizes the latest ES7 technologies in React.

In terms of application development, Material UI (styled component structure) has been employed for stylings, along with advanced and reusable components. This choice was made to ensure cross-browser compatibility, supporting Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Additionally, I opted against using static external CSS.

For state management, Redux Toolkit was utilized to enhance handling, reduce folder structure, and avoid the need for additional packages such as async middlewares for processing asynchronous requests.

The application boasts a logical component and folder structure, making it easy for anyone who has worked with it to understand and progress without any hassle.
